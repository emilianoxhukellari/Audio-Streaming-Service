# Audio-Streaming-Service
This project intended to develop an audio streaming service that supports multiple clients simultaneously and provides high-fidelity (HiFi) audio over the network. To achieve this goal, I implemented a low-level audio player that utilizes native Windows multimedia functions. Furthermore, I have implemented a substantial networking protocol that uses the reliable Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The audio streaming service manages to stream HiFi audio in a deterministic and dynamic manner based on how the users interact with their applications. The result is a two-application service that takes advantage of multithreading for maximum performance for streaming audio and for performing separate tasks. With the help of numerous algorithms, some of which run over the network, our audio streaming service manages to provide users with a satisfactory audio streaming experience.
